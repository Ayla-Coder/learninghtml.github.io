                <p>We'll ask for a small contribution to help cover the bus cost; don't worry, 
                    it'll cost much less than a taxi in Norway! I'll add payment options to the website soon.<br>

                    We're still finalizing the bus schedule, but we're pretty sure that we'll have it for both pick-up and drop-off. 
                    We need to know how many people want to take these buses so we can book the right sized bus for each time. </p>

                <p>Because of space, timing, and Norwegian alcohol laws, we were considering using drink vouchers instead of a regular 
                    card scanner at the bar. Vouchers will also be available on-site if needed. If all of this turns out to be too complicated, 
                    we'll keep the drinks simple and find a better alternative. If you want any mixed drinks, cider or beer in addition to the 
                    wine (and beer) we'll provide (for free) with dinner, please let us know so we can buy the correct amount of ingredients!

                    <p>
                        We are currently working on a drink menu that we will post to the website at some point. What we do know so far, is that 
                        we want to provide exciting mixed drinks with equally exciting <i>alcohol-free</i> versions! <br> <br>
                        Again, we haven't landed on the exact menu yet, but we know we want to serve piña coladas and margaritas made in a slushie 
                        machine, as well as beer, wine and maybe some home-brewed hard cider and beer too. You'll be able to buy packs of three on our 
                        website using Vipps, PayPal, or bank transfer. We’d really appreciate it if you purchase in advance to help us plan.
